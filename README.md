# CUBETHON

This is a simple game I made in a day while experimenting with the Unity game engine.

You play as a cube that has to avoid obstacles placed on a straight path, but it's a little more challenging than it might sound. To my surprise, no one in my family was able to get through all three levels.

Lots of thanks to [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA) for making the [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL&index=2) this game was based on.

## Playing the Game

I've decided to include some of the builds I made for this game. Simply download the folder for your OS/CPU architecture and run the executable.

Alternatively, download the source and build it on your own machine.
